# My Portfolio (work branch)

This repository hosts the in-progress portfolio redesign on the `work` branch. If you are looking for the branch with the latest UI updates, switch to `work` locally or in your Git hosting provider’s branch picker.

## Getting started

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

To create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Notes

- The current UI implementation lives in `src/App.jsx` with supporting styles in `src/App.css`.
- The project uses Vite + React; no additional build steps are required beyond the commands above.
- The latest updates are committed on the `work` branch; pull from `origin/work` to sync with the current code.
