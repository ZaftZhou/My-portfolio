    "title": "Unity3D Developer & Technical Artist",
    "bio": "Unity developer and hybrid generalist with a strong 3D art background. On the code side I focus on event-driven, data-driven systems in Unity and C# – using ScriptableObject-based data models, 
    state machines and decoupled services for gameplay, UI and AI – and I often build editor tools and small frameworks to simplify workflows and reduce repetitive work. Because I’ve done 3D modelling and texturing myself, I understand artists’ constraints and design pipelines and shaders that fit real production needs.",
